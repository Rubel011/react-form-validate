# React Hook Form with Zod Validation Example

This is a small project demonstrating the integration of React Hook Form with Zod for handling forms and validation. React Hook Form is a powerful library for managing form state in React applications with ease, while Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. By combining these two libraries, you can efficiently manage form inputs, validate data, and handle form submissions in a robust and type-safe manner.

## Features

- **React Hook Form**: Simplifies form management by providing a straightforward API to manage form state and validation.
- **Zod Validation**: Ensures data integrity and type safety by validating form inputs based on defined schemas.
- **Efficient Form Handling**: Streamlines form handling processes, including input registration, validation, error display, and form submission.
- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript to provide compile-time type checking for form data and validation schemas, reducing runtime errors.

## Installation
